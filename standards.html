       CONFORMATION STANDARDS
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Conformation Standards</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Proportional body symmetry and uphill balance.</li>
        <li>Well‑angled shoulder and strong, straight legs.</li>
        <li>Balanced neck and refined head structure.</li>
        <li>Powerful hindquarters supporting sport‑baroque movement.</li>
        <li>Adequate bone density and sound joints.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <!-- ============================================================
       HEIGHT & SIZE
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Height &amp; Size Standards</h2>
      <p>The LeopardFriesian is a sport‑baroque breed and should reflect substance and presence consistent with its Friesian heritage while maintaining athleticism.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimum height: 14.3 hands (all tiers).</li>
        <li>Preferred range: 15.1–16.3 hands.</li>
        <li>Horses under 14.3 hands may be registered in a separate Sport Pony division pending committee approval.</li>
        <li>Friesian‑influenced bone and substance is evaluated relative to height; finer builds from Appaloosa influence are assessed in proportion.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ============================================================
       TEMPERAMENT & MIND
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Temperament &amp; Mind</h2>
      <p>Registered horses demonstrate willingness, trainability, and emotional stability.
      Aggressive or unstable dispositions are disqualifying.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ============================================================
       PATTERN & COLOR STANDARDS
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Pattern &amp; Color Standards</h2>
      <p>The Appaloosa coat pattern is central to the LeopardFriesian identity. All registered horses must carry at least one copy of the LP gene (confirmed via DNA). The following patterns are recognized:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leopard</strong> — white body with dark spots over all or most of the body.</li>
        <li><strong>Blanket</strong> — solid or spotted white over the hindquarters.</li>
        <li><strong>Snowflake</strong> — white spots on a dark base, concentrated over the hindquarters.</li>
        <li><strong>Varnish Roan</strong> — dark base with progressive lightening and retained dark points.</li>
        <li><strong>Mottled / Few Spot</strong> — minimal patterning with characteristic mottled skin; acceptable provided LP genotype is confirmed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Breed identifiers — mottled skin around muzzle/eyes/genitalia, striped hooves, and a visible white sclera — must be present and documented in registration photographs.</p>
      <p>Base coat color (black, bay, chestnut, etc.) does not influence tier eligibility. Solid‑colored offspring of LP‑carrying parents may be registered as Non‑Pattern Carriers if LP heterozygosity is confirmed by DNA.</p>

       GENETIC REQUIREMENTS
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Genetic Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>DNA and microchip verification required for entry.</li>
        <li>Friesian percentage minimum per tier (F1/F2/F3+).</li>
        <li>Confirmed LP genotype and approved pattern source.</li>
        <li>Health testing: HYPP N/N required; OLWS, CA, DW, and MCOA panel strongly recommended and must be disclosed at registration.</li>
        <li>Homozygous LP (LP/LP) status must be declared; see Breeding Ethics for restrictions.</li>
        <li>Parentage verification by DNA is required for all breeding stock.</li>

       HEALTH & SOUNDNESS
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Health &amp; Soundness</h2>
      <p>The LeopardFriesian registry prioritizes the long‑term welfare and soundness of the breed. The following standards apply to all registered horses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mandatory testing:</strong> HYPP (N/N required for registration). Horses testing H/H are ineligible for registration.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclosed testing:</strong> Results for OLWS (Overo Lethal White Syndrome), CA (Cerebellar Abiotrophy), DW (Dwarfism), and MCOA (Multiple Congenital Ocular Anomalies) must be submitted at registration. Carriers may be registered with appropriate notation.</li>
        <li><strong>Vision &amp; LP health:</strong> Horses confirmed LP/LP (homozygous) are at elevated risk for Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB). Owners must be informed of this risk in writing at registration. An ophthalmological evaluation is strongly recommended for all breeding stock.</li>
        <li><strong>Soundness exam:</strong> A veterinary pre‑registration soundness examination is required for all horses entering the Breeding Stock registry. A licensed veterinarian must complete and sign the registry's official soundness form.</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing welfare:</strong> Registered horses found to be in neglect or chronic unsound condition may have registration privileges suspended pending review by the welfare committee.</li>
      </ul>

       BREEDING ETHICS
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Breeding Ethics</h2>
      <p>Breeders registered with the LeopardFriesian registry are expected to uphold the highest standards of equine welfare and responsible breeding practice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Homozygous LP breeding restriction:</strong> Breeding two LP/LP (homozygous leopard) horses together is prohibited under registry rules. This cross produces a high rate of foals with severe ocular abnormalities and CSNB. Stallions or mares confirmed LP/LP may only be bred to LP/lp or lp/lp partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum breeding age:</strong> Mares must be a minimum of 3 years of age. Stallions must be a minimum of 3 years of age and approved for breeding by registry inspection.</li>
        <li><strong>Linebreeding limits:</strong> Breeding of half‑siblings, parent to offspring, or closer relationships is prohibited. Grandfather/granddaughter or equivalent crosses require a written genetic diversity justification submitted to the registry.</li>
        <li><strong>Stallion approval:</strong> All breeding stallions must undergo a registry inspection covering conformation, temperament, movement, and health testing before offspring are eligible for registration.</li>
        <li><strong>Breeder code of ethics:</strong> All registered breeders agree to the registry's Code of Ethics, covering honest representation of horses, full health disclosure to buyers, and humane husbandry practices. Violations may result in suspension or termination of registry membership.</li>
      </ul>

       REGISTRATION & RECORDKEEPING
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Registration &amp; Recordkeeping</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Naming conventions:</strong> Registered names may be up to 30 characters including spaces. Names may not duplicate an existing registered horse within the same generation tier. Breeder prefix or farm name may be included but is not required.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo documentation:</strong> A minimum of four photographs are required at registration: left profile, right profile, front facing, and a close‑up of mottled skin markings. Pattern documentation photos must be taken on a clipped or clean coat.</li>
        <li><strong>Microchip:</strong> ISO‑standard 15‑digit microchip placement is required prior to registration. Chip number must match DNA submission paperwork.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer of ownership:</strong> Ownership transfers must be submitted to the registry within 60 days of sale. Both seller and buyer signatures are required. Transfer fees apply per the current fee schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>Lifetime registration:</strong> Registration is lifetime for the individual horse. Annual renewal is not required. Breeding stock approval and stallion licenses are subject to annual review.</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicate certificates:</strong> Replacement registration certificates may be requested for a nominal fee with proof of ownership.</li>
      </ul>

       PERFORMANCE & SPORT CRITERIA
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Performance &amp; Sport Criteria</h2>
      <p>The LeopardFriesian is bred for versatility across sport and baroque disciplines. An optional Performance Registry designation recognizes horses that demonstrate excellence in movement and training.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Movement scoring:</strong> Horses applying for Performance Registry designation are evaluated on a 10‑point scale across walk, trot, and canter. A minimum average score of 6.5 is required. Evaluation must be conducted by a registry‑approved judge.</li>
        <li><strong>Accepted disciplines:</strong> Dressage, driving, trail/endurance, western dressage, liberty, and show halter are all recognized disciplines for performance documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance points:</strong> Horses may accumulate performance points through registry‑recognized shows and events. Annual performance awards are given at Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Youth program:</strong> A junior exhibitor division is available for riders under 18, with age‑appropriate classes and awards tracked separately.</li>
      </ul>

       GOVERNANCE
  ============================================================ -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Governance</h2>
      <p>The LeopardFriesian registry is governed by a standing committee committed to the integrity, welfare, and growth of the breed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Appeals process:</strong> Any applicant whose registration is denied may submit a written appeal within 30 days of denial. Appeals are reviewed by a three‑member panel not involved in the original decision. The panel's decision is final.</li>
        <li><strong>Standards amendments:</strong> Proposed amendments to the breed standard may be submitted by any active member in good standing. Amendments require a two‑thirds majority vote of the governance committee and are published for a 60‑day member comment period before adoption.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Meeting minutes, fee schedules, and approved standards documents are published on the registry website and available to all members.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict of interest:</strong> Committee members with a direct financial interest in a registration decision must recuse themselves from that review.</li>
        <li><strong>Membership in good standing:</strong> Active breeders and owners must maintain current membership dues, have no outstanding registry violations, and be in compliance with all health reporting requirements to exercise voting rights.</li>
